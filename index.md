I'm a postgraduate researcher at the Open University (UK) where I research how to program computers by playing musical instruments such as the electric guitar.

My research interests are in the following areas:
- new interfaces for musical interaction
- live coding
- improvisation
- signal processing
- synthesis techniques
- spatial audio
